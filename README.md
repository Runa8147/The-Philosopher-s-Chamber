# The Philosopher's Chamber 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Stoic

### Project Description
This project creates an engaging single-page web application simulating a philosophical debate between Aristotle and Socrates, powered by AI (Gemini & Gemma). Users enter a virtual museum environment, select a debate topic, and witness an AI-generated conversation, enhanced with animations and text-to-speech. This blends education and entertainment, offering an interactive and visually appealing exploration of philosophical ideas. 🏛🗣

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People want someone to debate on given topic or we are testing AI debate capabalities and potential to win over humans.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've conjured a time machine, but instead of sending people back, we're bringing the past to the present! 🧙‍♂️🔮
We are making AI debate like Socrates and Aristotle
